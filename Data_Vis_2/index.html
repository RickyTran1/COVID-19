          <h2>Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in Each Australian State per 10,000 Population</h2>
          <p>The number of confirmed Coronavirus cases per 10,000 population in each Australian state has been even. Every state besides Victoria has shown a confirmed case per 10,000 population of less than 10. Northern Territory and the ACT have been particularly well at keeping the cases low, at less than 2 per 10,000 population. Victoria has clearly not been able to respond as well as the other states showing a confirmed case per 10,000 population of 30.42, which is greater than all the other states combined.</p>

          <h2>The Trend of Daily COVID-19 Cases per 10,000 Population of Each Australian State</h2>
	  <p>The line graph shows that every state besides Tasmania and Victoria peaked in the amount of cases daily during mid to late March, at a maximum of 0.302 daily cases per 10,000 population coming from the ACT. Tasmania peaked in daily cases during mid April at 0.278 cases per 10,000 population. Victoria once again suffered the biggest peak of daily cases out of all the other states. Victoria experienced its peak much later than the rest of the states, during very early August, so around 4 months later than the other states. This peak spiked to the greatest amount of recorded daily cases in Australia at 700 cases on the 5th of August, normalised to 1.046 per 10,000 population.</p>

          <h2>COVID-19 Deaths by Age and Gender in Australia</h2>
          <p>This visualisation shows the deaths by age and gender caused from the Coronavirus. This population pyramid shows overwhelming evidence that the Coronavirus is of a greater risk to the elderly than it is to younger individuals. Almost every death caused by the Coronavirus was from those aged greater than 60 years old, where a vast majority of these deaths were from those aged greater than 70. The deaths of those greater than 70 years old totalled 843 from the 901 total deaths recorded in Australia, this amounts to 93.5% of the total deaths in Australia being attributed to those aged 70 or higher. Although there are some visible differences between the amount female deaths and male deaths, the evidence is not as overwhelming as it is with age, and no conclusions can really be drawn from gender alone.</p>

          <h2>Confirmed COVID-19 Cases and Testing Rate per Local Government Area in Victoria</h2>
          <p>Now we'll go deeper into our analysis and explore the state that suffered the most from COVID-19, Victoria. More specifically the confirmed cases and testing rate per Local Government Area in Victoria. This visualisation shows the testing rate vs the confirmed cases in each LGA within Victoria, where the size of the bubbles represent the population of each LGA. From this understanding, we can see that despite the high amount of tests conducted in LGAs such as Ararat, they didn't record many confirmed cases, meaning their confirmed cases to tests ratio was not high. Another LGAs such as Wyndham, recorded the most amount of confirmed cases out of any other LGA at 2,265 cases, but also didn't conduct as many tests like Darebin, meaning it had quite a high confirmed cases to tests ratio.</p>
